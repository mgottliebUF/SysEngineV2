# SysEngineV2
This is a systems engineering toolkit that will allow systems engineers to be more effective. 

To run this project, open a IDE (example: Jupyter notebook) and copy/paste the script. 

You can save a copy of your project and after re-running the script, you can open a saved JSON of your project and continue to build your product. 

This is the public version of the script and an additonal SysML modeling feature and LLM feature are being integrated into a private version of the product. 

The ultimate goal is to integrate the Engineering LLM model in development to provide requirement traceability suggestions and use an additonal seperate model to create SysML viewpoints automatically based on requirements and CONOPS information.
